<h1>ANALYTICS INFO</h1><br/>


<h5>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE :</h5> AI is that the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines
AI can meaningfully improve people's lives which the most important impact will come when everyone can access it. 
Learn more about it.<br/><br/>

<h5>DATA SCIENCE:</h5> Data Science combines the scientific system, calculation and statistics, specialized programming, 
advanced analytics, AI, and indeed liar to uncover and explain the business perceptivity buried in data. Learn more about it.<br/><br/>

<h5>MACHINE LEARNING :</h5> Machine learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses
 on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Learn more about it.<br/><br/>

<h5>R :</h3> The R programing language is an open source scripting language for predictive analytics and data visualization.
Learn more about it.<br/><br/>

<h5>NEURAL NETWORK (NN) :</h5> A neural network may be a series of algorithms that endeavors to acknowledge underlying
 relationships during a set of knowledge through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Learn more about it.<br/><br/>


<h5>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP):</h5> Natural language processing strives to create machines that understand and
 answer text or voice data—and respond with text or speech of their own—in much an equivalent way humans do. Learn more about it.<br/><br/>

<h5>NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING (NLU):</h5>  Involves transforming human language into a machine-readable format.
 With the help of natural language understanding (NLU) and machine learning, computers can automatically analyze data in seconds.
  Learn more about it<br/><br/>

<h5>PYTHON:</h5> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
 Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for
  Rapid Application Development. Learn more about it.<br/><br/>
