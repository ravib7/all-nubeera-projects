                                 Instead of releasing big sets of features, companies are trying to see if small features
                                 can be transported to their customers through a series of release trains.
                                 This has many advantages like quick feedback from customers, better quality of software
                                 etc. which in turn leads to high customer satisfaction.
                                 To achieve this, companies are required to increase deployment frequency. This ensures:

                                       Lower failure rate of new releases

                                    <li>
                                       Shortened lead time between fixes

                                       Faster mean time to recovery in the event of new release crashing

                                 DevOps fulfills all these requirements and helps in achieving seamless software delivery.
                                 You can give examples of companies like Etsy, Google and Amazon which have adopted DevOps
                                 to achieve levels of performance that were unthinkable even five years ago.
                                 They are doing tens, hundreds or even thousands of code deployments per day while
                                 delivering world class stability, reliability and security.

                                 Agile is a set of values and principles about how to produce i.e. develop software.
                                 Example: if you have some ideas and you want to turn those ideas into working software,
                                 you can use the Agile values and principles as a way to do that.
                                 But, that software might only be working on a developerâ€™s laptop or in a test environment.
                                 You want a way to quickly, easily and repeatably move that software into production
                                 infrastructure, in a safe and simple way.
                                 To do that you need DevOps tools and techniques.<br />
                                 <br />
                                 You can summarize by saying Agile software development methodology focuses on the
                                 development of software but DevOps on the other hand is responsible for development as
                                 well as deployment of the software in the safest and most reliable way possible.

                                 The most important thing that DevOps helps us achieve is to get the changes into
                                 production as quickly as possible while minimizing risks in software quality assurance and
                                 compliance.
                                 This is the primary objective of DevOps.
                                 However, you can add many other positive effects of DevOps.
                                 For example, clearer communication and better working relationships between teams i.e.
                                 both the Ops team and Dev team collaborate together to deliver good quality software which
                                 in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction.

                                 Etsy is a peer-to-peer e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and
                                 supplies, as well as unique factory-manufactured items.
                                 Etsy struggled with slow, painful site updates that frequently caused the site to go down.
                                 It affected sales for millions of Etsyâ€™s users who sold goods through online market place
                                 and risked driving them to the competitor. <br />
                                 With the help of a new technical management team, Etsy transitioned from its waterfall
                                 model, which produced four-hour full-site deployments twice weekly, to a more agile
                                 approach.
                                 Today, it has a fully automated deployment pipeline, and its continuous delivery practices
                                 have reportedly resulted in more than 50 deployments a day with fewer disruptions.

                                 AWS for DevOps ushers a whole gamut of advantages. Some of them are: <br />

                                       <strong>Easy to start and easy to use: </strong>Unlike the traditional software
                                       development processes where the first step would be to install a particular
                                       software, AWS does not have any additional installation requisites. All you need is
                                       to open an AWS account online to access the treasure trove of Amazon Web Services.

                                       <strong>Comprehensive services: </strong>AWS offers fully managed operations, so the

                                       requirements such as setting up and installation. As soon as you set up your AWS
                                       account, the infrastructural requirements are automatically taken care of by DevOps.
                                       This enables the customers to direct their attention straight to building their core
                                       product.

                                       it feasible to scale up from a single instance to multiples of thousands without any

                                       Management mechanism grants the customer complete control over the access and use of
                                       their resources. Customers can set permissions about access to different levels of

                                       transformed the e-commerce ecosystem by directly integrating a considerable cohort
                                       of customers and service partners. Members of this dynamic community can forge a

                                       <strong>Pay-As-You-Go: </strong>This feature is what really sets AWS apart. Unlike
                                       traditional platforms, AWS does not levy any upfront fees or paid package to avail
                                       of their services. You may opt for specific services and pay only for those and for
                                       the period of time that suits your needs. AWS does not impose any contractual

                                       AWS CodeBuild is a granular code building tool that is fully managed
                                       in order to build source codes, run tests, and make ready to deploy software
                                       packages.
                                       By virtue of the AWS CodeBuild, developers need to wait for their codes to be scaled
                                       since it continuously and simultaneously scales multiple builds.
